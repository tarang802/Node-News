# Node-News
 ðŸ“° Basic News Website Using Local News API.



This is a simple news website built with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS, featuring a homepage that displays the latest articles and a search bar to find specific news. It fetches data from a public news API and provides dynamic rendering of content with error handling. I also used a little bit of scss for this project just to try it our :)
